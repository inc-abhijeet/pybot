This are some of the features to be implemented in the future:

- A better website for pybot.

- Adapt distutils classes to install every necessary file in their respective
  directories.

- Develop a README explaining how to do the basic setup of pybot.

- Cross identification between servers (is this useful?).

- Setup pybot nick when connecting.

- Limit log search to the same server.

- Develop admin module for direct sql access.
