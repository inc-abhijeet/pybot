This are some of the features to be implemented in the future:

- A better website for pybot.

- Documentation!! Please, write documentation. :-)

- Include every module in the online help system.

- Adapt distutils classes to install every necessary file in their respective
  directories.

- Finish the conversion of msg.match to re.match and remove msg.match from
  the code.

- Give users a chance to identify themselves to pybot when they are in
  other servers than their registered ones. Must discover some way to
  detect when the user has left and auto-logout him

- Develop a README explaining how to do the basic setup of pybot.

- Remove the parameter from __loadmodule() and __unloadmodule__(), and convert
  them to use a general "mod" name for the instance.
