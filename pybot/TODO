This are some of the features to be implemented in the future:

- A better website for pybot.

- Include every module in the online help system.

- Adapt distutils classes to install every necessary file in their respective
  directories.

- Finish the conversion of msg.match to re.match and remove msg.match from
  the code.

- Develop a README explaining how to do the basic setup of pybot.

- Remove the parameter from __loadmodule() and __unloadmodule__(), and convert
  them to use a general "mod" name for the instance.

- Cross identification between servers.

- Include help topics when registering a help entry.

- Include help for permissions.

- Perhaps move all option system to sqlite.
