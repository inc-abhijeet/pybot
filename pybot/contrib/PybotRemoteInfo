## This is a sample file for MoinMoin (http://moin.sourceforge.net) to
## use with the remoteinfo module.
##

## 
## pybot: load remote info from
##   http://example.com/moin.cgi/PybotRemoteInfo?action=raw
##   with regex \s(?:\[(?P<flags>\w*)\])?\s*(?P<trigger>.*?)\s*::(?P<msg>.*)

== Documentation ==
This file will be loaded into pybot each 10 minutes to include additional
intelligence in the bot. Each line in that file has the following syntax:

{{{ [flags] regex:: message}}}

Notice that the line must start with a space, and the flags part is optional.

The following flags are understood:
 * '''a''' -- disable the inclusion of the user nick at the start of the line on channel messages;
 * '''g''' -- check even channel messages not targeted to pybot;
 * '''s''' -- makes the regex case sensitive.

The message may also be prefixed by '''/me''' or '''/notice''' to have the expected meanings.

Group replacement may happen on the message.

Here is a nice example:

{{{ [g] Hi (?P<someone>.*?)[.!]*:: /me says hi to %(someone)s as well!}}}

If you don't want to wait 10 minutes to see your changes in pybot, you can ask him to load
them immediately, with the following message:

{{{pybot: reload remote info from https://moin.conectiva.com.br/PybotRemoteInfo?action=raw}}}
