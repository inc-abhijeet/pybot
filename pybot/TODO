This are some of the features to be implemented in the future:

- Adapt distutils classes to install every necessary file in their respective
  directories.

- Develop a README explaining how to do the basic setup of pybot.

- Cross identification between servers (is this useful?).

- Develop admin module for direct sql access.

- Add timed messages in the messages.py module.

- Perhaps a "karma" module, implementing word++ and word--?

- Check ideas from http://olut.ton.tut.fi/~karhu/ and http://supybot.sf.net.
